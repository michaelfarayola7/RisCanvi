This dataset is the 5th series of studies initiated 33 years ago where, approximately every 5 or 6, the recidivism rate of people who have been released from prison in a given year (in this case, in 2015) has been collected and they have been followed for 5 years (in this case, until 2020) to find out if they have returned to prison for a new crime committed after their release. This 5-year follow-up period is what international studies consider valid and sufficient to consider a person a quitter if they have not reoffended again in this interval. In addition, it has been decided to cut off follow-up before the COVID19 pandemic, given that all the international studies consulted advise further suppressing the effect that this pandemic may have had on the results of research that had not had this type of phenomenon in previous follow-up periods.

The concept of recidivism used is that of penitentiary recidivism (new entry into the penitentiary system, whether as a preventive or sentenced person) and recidivism in penal execution in the community (cases that commit a new criminal act with a new sentence to an alternative penal measure -MPA-). And for the first time, the judicial fee is used, which would be the new entry of a file into the courts (whether as a suspect or as a convicted person).

The data has been extracted from SIJJ (Alternative Penal Measures Information System) and SIPC (Catalan Penitentiary Information System) and an Excel file has been obtained with data from TEMIS, the database of the Administration of Justice.
